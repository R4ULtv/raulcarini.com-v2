Hey everyone! As 2024 winds down, I wanted to share something I've been working on: a personalized "Developer Wrapped" web app to visualize my coding journey this past year. It's been a fantastic year of learning, building, and pushing my boundaries, and this project helped me reflect on it all.

## What is Developer Wrapped?

Inspired by the popular year-in-review formats, I created a web app using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and a few cool animation libraries to showcase my key development metrics and achievements. It's a fun, interactive way to look back at the year through the lens of data points like GitHub contributions, website traffic, and other relevant numbers.

### Key Features

*   **Interactive Components:** The app is filled with engaging elements built with custom components. You'll see things like the `Tilt` effect, smoothly animated numbers, text that loops, and fading text effects.
*   **Modern Design:** I used Tailwind CSS for styling, resulting in a sleek, modern aesthetic that's pleasing to the eye.
*   **Responsive Layout:** The grid system adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, so the experience is great on any device.
*   **Custom Icons:** I created and integrated custom icons for services like GitHub and others, adding a personalized touch.

## A Sneak Peek at My 2024 Wrapped

Here's a glimpse at what my 2024 Developer Wrapped looks like:

- **217 Days of Contributions:** I've been actively contributing to projects on GitHub for most of the year!
- **Most Active Day:** Friday seems to be my prime day for coding.
- **0 Stripe Transactions**:  ...I'm gonna work on that in 2025.
- **5 Active Websites:** I've been maintaining several websites.
- **39k Website Visitors:** I'm grateful for all the visitors to my websites and blog posts.
- **1973 Contributions:** This shows my level of engagement with my projects.
- **3261 Total Blog Views:** Thanks for reading!

## Customization

The project is designed to be highly customizable. Feel free to update the data, tweak the styling, modify the animations, or add your own icons to make it unique.

*   **Data:** Modify the values in the `page.js` component to reflect your personal metrics.
*   **Styling:** Customize the styling using Tailwind CSS classes within the `Card` components.
*   **Animations:** Modify the animation components (`components/animation`) to create unique effects.
*   **Icons:** Add custom icons by creating additional components in `utils/icons.js`.
*   **Layout:** Adjust the grid layout to accommodate additional cards.

## Looking Ahead to 2025

This project was not only a fun experiment but also a great opportunity to reflect on my progress this year.
I'm excited to take this momentum into 2025, with a focus on contributing more to open source projects, learning new technologies, and further developing my skills.

I encourage you all to try this project and create your own "Developer Wrapped."
It's a fantastic way to appreciate your own journey.

Thanks for reading!
