As a web developer, I'm always on the lookout for ways to make the user experience smoother and more engaging. We often talk about performance, speed, and accessibility, but sometimes, it's the small visual details that truly elevate a website.

That's where the [View Transitions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API) comes in, and honestly, it's a game-changer for how we think about page transitions on the web.
It doesn't matter if you're building a single-page application (SPA) or a multi-page application (MPA), this API has something for you!

## What's the Buzz About View Transitions?

Think about your favorite mobile apps. The transitions between screens are usually fluid and visually appealing.
They're not jarring cuts; they're smooth animations that help you understand the change in context.
Historically, this kind of slick transition has been difficult to achieve on the web. We often relied on third-party libraries or custom JavaScript implementations, which could be complex and sometimes buggy.

That's where the View Transitions API steps in.
It's a browser-native way to handle these transitions with minimal code and maximum performance.
Instead of a hard reload when navigating between pages or sections, it lets us animate elements visually.
It's like giving our websites a much-needed dose of that mobile app magic.
And the great thing is, whether you're building a dynamic single-page app (SPA) or a more traditional multi-page site (MPA), the View Transitions API has you covered.

## The Technical Breakdown (Don't Worry, I'll Keep it Simple!)

Under the hood, the View Transitions API works by capturing snapshots of the "before" and "after" states of your page.
It then identifies which elements on the page are shared between those states. These shared elements are then animated to create the transition.

Here's a simple breakdown:

- **Snapshotting**: When a transition is initiated (like a navigation or a component change), the API takes a "before" snapshot of the DOM (Document Object Model â€“ think of it as the structure of your webpage).
- **DOM Changes**: You, the developer, make the changes to the DOM that you want.
- **Snapshotting Again**: The API takes an "after" snapshot.
- **Matching Elements**: The API looks for matching elements between the two snapshots based on a "view-transition-name" property that you assign to the element.
- **Animation**: The API automatically animates the matched elements from their "before" state to their "after" state, creating a smooth, visually appealing transition.
  It uses performant CSS animations under the hood, which also means we get more control to customize those transitions.

## Why is This So Cool?

- **Improved User Experience**: Smooth transitions reduce visual jarring and make the site feel more polished and intuitive. It's like a more professional and less "clunky" experience for the user.

- **Native Performance**: Since it's a browser API, it's more efficient than relying on custom JavaScript solutions.
  Browsers handle the heavy lifting, freeing up valuable resources.

- **Simplified Development**: You don't need to wrangle complicated JavaScript libraries or build your own animation systems.
  The API is easy to learn and implement, allowing developers to focus on more critical tasks.

- **Customizable Animations**: The API lets you use CSS to style the animations and control their duration, easing, and other parameters, giving a lot of creative freedom to developers.

- **Works for SPAs and MPAs**: Whether you are building a single page application or multiple pages the API works for you, so you don't need to create different strategies to handle the transitions in your applications.

## Practical Examples (Imagine These!)

Here are some scenarios where you'd see view transitions in action:

- **Product Listings**: Imagine clicking on a thumbnail image on a product listing page.
  Instead of a jarring page load, the thumbnail smoothly expands into a full-size product image on the product detail page.

- **Navigation**: A fixed navigation bar could seamlessly stay in place as you navigate from one page to another without any visual flickering.

- **Dynamic Lists**: Think of a list or grid that rearranges items as you filter through.
  View transitions can make these changes visually pleasing, showing items shifting positions smoothly instead of just popping into place.

## Two Flavors of View Transitions: Same-Document & Cross-Document

The View Transitions API offers two primary ways to handle transitions:

- **Same-Document Transitions**: This is primarily used in single-page applications (SPAs).
  The transition happens entirely within a single HTML page.
  You trigger this kind of transition using document.startViewTransition() before updating the DOM.

  ```js
  function handleClick(e) {
    // Fallback for browsers that don't support this API:
    if (!document.startViewTransition) {
      updateTheDOMSomehow();
      return;
    }

    // With a View Transition:
    document.startViewTransition(() => updateTheDOMSomehow());
  }
  ```

  Imagine a photo gallery in an SPA, where clicking a thumbnail expands it within the same page. That's a same-document transition!
  This is available on [Chrome and Edge since version 111](https://caniuse.com/view-transitions) and on Safari since version 18.

- **Cross-Document Transitions**: This is used for multi-page applications (MPAs), where you are navigating between separate HTML pages.
  Here, you don't need to call any API directly.
  Instead, you opt-in to transitions by using this CSS:
  ```css
  @view-transition {
    navigation: auto;
  }
  ```
  When a user clicks a link that causes navigation to another page, the browser automatically animates the transition if both pages have opted-in.
  Think of an e-commerce website that takes you from the product listing page to a product page: this could be a cross-document transition.
  This is available in Chrome and Edge from version 126, and on Safari's Technology Preview.

## View Transitions in Next.js: Even Easier!

For those using the popular React framework, Next.js, integrating the View Transitions API is becoming even more straightforward thanks to libraries like [next-view-transitions](https://github.com/khulnasoft-lab/next-view-transitions).
This library simplifies the process, allowing you to easily add smooth transitions to your Next.js apps.

Here's how it works in a nutshell:

1. **Installation**: You'll need to install the next-view-transitions package using your package manager:
   ```bash
   pnpm install next-view-transitions
   ```
2. **Wrap Your Layout**: In your root layout file (usually app/layout.js or app/layout.tsx), wrap your content with the `<ViewTransitions>` component:

   ```js
   import { ViewTransitions } from "next-view-transitions";

   export default function Layout({ children }) {
     return (
       <ViewTransitions>
         <html lang="en">
           <body>{children}</body>
         </html>
       </ViewTransitions>
     );
   }
   ```

3. Use `<Link>` or useTransitionRouter:

   - For standard links, use the `<Link>` component provided by next-view-transitions instead of the default Next.js `<Link>`:

   ```js
   import { Link } from "next-view-transitions";

   export default function Component() {
     return (
       <div>
         <Link href="/about">Go to /about</Link>
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

   - For programmatic navigation, use the `useTransitionRouter` hook:

   ```js
   import { useTransitionRouter } from "next-view-transitions";

   export default function Component() {
     const router = useTransitionRouter();
     return (
       <div>
         <button
           onClick={() => {
             router.push("/about");
           }}
         >
           Go to /about
         </button>
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

That's it! With just a few changes you can enable transitions in your Next.js apps.

This library effectively handles the complexities of triggering and managing view transitions within the Next.js ecosystem, allowing you to focus on creating engaging animations without writing tons of boilerplate code.
While this library covers basic cases, keep in mind that more complex scenarios with features like concurrent rendering or streaming might require more advanced solutions that are yet to be implemented by React and Next.js.
