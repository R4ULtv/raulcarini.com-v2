Hey folks! Super stoked to tell you about a big update to my blog that's gonna make things way better for everyone who follows what I do. Let me show you what's new and why I switched things up.

## What's New?
I've given the blog a total makeover to make it more organized and user-friendly, and better match what I'm up to these days.
The new setup makes it super easy to find and follow the stuff you care about most.

## Why This Update?
As I got into different things, I realized my old blog setup just wasn't cutting it anymore.
Until now, I've mainly focused on sharing my professional projects, but there's so much more I want to share with you all.
The old way felt kinda meh, and I wanted to make something that really shows off all the cool stuff I'm working on.

## Blog Categories

### Projects
This is my bread and butter - everything related to my professional work that you've come to know and expect from my blog.

I'll take you behind the scenes of my development processes, share detailed code walkthroughs, and provide technical tutorials to help you learn from my experiences.

You'll get comprehensive case studies of completed projects, exploring what worked, what didn't, and what I learned along the way.
I'll also dive into tech stack discussions and implementation details, giving you insights into the tools and technologies I use.
This category has been my main focus until now, so if you've been following my blog, you'll feel right at home here.

## More Frequent Updates
With this new setup, I'm making it a point to post way more often.
While Projects has been my main focus until now, you'll start seeing regular content in Updates and Articles too.
You'll see new stuff popping up all the time, so there's always something fresh to check out.

I'm aiming to maintain this posting schedule:
- **Projects**: 1-2 detailed technical posts per month
- **Updates**: Weekly quick updates about ongoing work
- **Articles**: 3-4 in-depth articles per month

## Looking Forward
I'm super pumped about expanding beyond just project updates. Whether you're here for the technical deep-dives in Projects, keeping up with my latest work in Updates, or diving into broader discussions in Articles, there's going to be something for everyone.
