In a world saturated with complex and often cumbersome tools, Texta emerges as a breath of fresh air.
It's not just another text editor; it's a carefully crafted experience designed to empower writers, developers, and content creators with a seamless, intuitive, and powerful writing environment.

Texta combines a clean, minimalist interface with robust formatting capabilities and the intelligent assistance of AI, all working in harmony to enhance your creative process.
This project was born out of a desire for simplicity without sacrificing functionality, leading to a tool that's as elegant as it is effective. Whether you're crafting a blog post, coding a project, or brainstorming ideas, Texta aims to redefine how you interact with your written content.

## Where the Idea Came From

The concept for Texta was born out of a very personal frustration.
As a writer and developer, I constantly found myself toggling between overly complex, feature-laden text editors and those that were too simplistic to handle my needs.
The former were often bloated and distracting, while the latter lacked essential formatting tools and offered little in the way of assistance.

I yearned for an environment where I could focus solely on the act of creation, with a clean and intuitive interface, the flexibility of rich text, and the intelligent support of AI, which made it essential to craft a tool that could seamlessly blend these elements into one cohesive experience.
This need became the driving force behind Texta, an editor designed not just for my personal use, but for all those seeking a more streamlined and efficient way to write and create.

## How I Built It (Using Next.js, TipTap, and More)

Bringing Texta to life was a solo endeavor, a journey where I wore many hats - that of a developer, designer, tester, and even UX researcher.
The architectural bedrock of Texta lies in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), chosen for its impressive performance, flexibility, and its ability to deliver a modern web application experience.
To handle the complexities of rich text editing and Markdown support, I turned to [TipTap](https://tiptap.dev), which gave me the ability to create a robust, feature-rich, and user-friendly editing core.

To ensure the visual aspect of the editor was as clean and minimalist as the writing experience, I used [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). Furthermore, I utilized [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com) and [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com) to craft highly customizable and accessible UI components, ensuring Texta is both beautiful and inclusive.
The project was also hosted by [Vercel](https://vercel.com), highlighting its ease of deployment and reliability. This carefully curated tech stack was paramount to achieving the balance of simplicity and power that defines Texta.

### Core Technologies and Their Roles

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org)**: Served as the foundation, providing server-side rendering, routing, and API capabilities, ensuring optimal performance and a smooth user experience. The fact that the editor is a client-side component use client is critical for enabling dynamic interactions.

- **[TipTap](https://tiptap.dev)**: Formed the core of Texta's editing capabilities.
  It provided the tools to manipulate rich text, handle Markdown, and create custom extensions.
  This is how the Code extension is configured to add custom styling:
  ```js
  const editor = useEditor({
    extensions: [
      Code.configure({
        HTMLAttributes: {
          class: "bg-zinc-200 px-1 py-0.5 rounded text-zinc-700",
        },
      }),
    ],
  });
  ```
  This configures the `Code` extension, adding a custom class `bg-zinc-200 px-1 py-0.5 rounded text-zinc-700` to the HTML generated for inline code snippets. This allows to customize its appearance without the need for inline styles.
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)**: Created the clean, consistent, and responsive design of Texta.
- **[Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com)**: Provided accessible and customizable components, ensuring a user experience that is both functional and inclusive, especially for dropdown menus, tooltips, and dialogs.
- **UI Elements**: Custom dialogs were created to handle different type of user inputs for actions such as adding links, media and external content.
  These are managed using a useDialog custom hook to control dialogs open states.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: The handleKeyDown function implements the logic for tracking key presses for both sound feedback and preventing repeated actions.
  The main purpose is also to enable shortcuts such as `⌘ B` for bold. Audio feedback is managed using `useKeyboardSound`.
- **Drag and Drop**: The handleDrop function allows users to drag and drop images directly into the editor.
  This feature validates the files, reads them as a data URL, and inserts them using the editor API.
- **Toolbar Logic**: The toolbar maps functions to button components through the commands array, for formatting and handling different content types.
  The buttons update their state using the Tiptap API.
- **Undo/Redo**: The undo and redo buttons are implemented using the TipTap API to manage the editor's history, allowing to easily revert or reapply changes

### Key Takeaways from the Implementation

The architecture was designed to be highly customizable through custom extensions, modularity, and responsiveness, ensured with libraries like [Tiptap](https://tiptap.dev) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).
The integration with [Headless UI](https://headlessui.com) and [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com) ensures accessibility and the seamless implementation of UI components.

By meticulously integrating these technologies, Texta achieves a seamless balance of power, simplicity, and user-friendliness.
This detailed explanation highlights the complexity and care that went into crafting Texta - Editor.

## The Goals

My overarching goal with [Texta](https://editor.raulcarini.dev) was to go beyond a typical text editor and craft a tool that actively enhances the writing process itself.
This vision is centered on several core principles:

- **A Distraction-Free Environment**: To create a writing space that puts the focus on content, with a minimalistic interface that encourages deep focus and concentration.
- **Comprehensive Formatting Tools**: To provide a rich array of formatting options, such as multiple heading styles, lists, blockquotes, code blocks, and more, all easily accessible via the intuitive toolbar and keyboard shortcuts.
- **Seamless AI Integration**: To leverage the power of AI not as a crutch, but as a collaborative partner in the writing process, offering assistance to improve, translate, summarize, and refine content.
- **Intuitive and Efficient Workflow**: To provide an intuitive interface with customizable keyboard shortcuts, ensuring a fluid and uninterrupted writing experience.
- **Universal Accessibility**: To ensure that the editor is responsive and accessible across a wide variety of devices, making it accessible wherever you are.
- **Custom Components for Streaming Generation**: Implement custom components to handle the generation of AI outputs, without overwhelming the user.

## The Advantages of Using AI in the Browser

A key differentiator for Texta is its use of in-browser AI capabilities, which, as explained in my blog post [Built-In AI with Chrome](/blog/built-in-ai-with-chrome), offers several key benefits.
Unlike external AI services, browser-based AI ensures enhanced privacy by keeping your data local, eliminating the risk of sending your sensitive information to third-party servers.

Furthermore, this approach creates a more seamless and contextual writing experience. In Texta, AI becomes an inherent part of the writing process, offering suggestions, correcting grammar, adjusting tone, translating languages, and summarizing text without ever breaking your concentration.
This integrated AI approach, powered by [Google AI for Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/ai/built-in), transforms how we interact with written content, enhancing, rather than disrupting, the creative flow.

## Small Section About the Hackathon

I built Texta during the [Google Chrome Built-in AI Challenge](https://googlechromeai.devpost.com/) hackathon. This event focused on using Chrome's new built-in AI features like Gemini Nano to create innovative web apps.
