Shortly is a web service that allows you to shorten **long and complex URLs** into **short and memorable links**.
In simple terms, Shortly acts as an intermediary between the end user and the desired destination.
When a user clicks on a shortened link generated by Shortly, they are automatically redirected to the original URL.
For example, if I have a link https://example.com/aVeryLongLink it could become [shrly.cc/xZVl](https://shrly.cc/xZVl).

## Where did the idea for Shortly come from?

Shortly began as a small summer project, born out of a personal challenge to _replicate_ the functionality of established URL shortening services like [bit.ly](https://bitly.com_).
It was a way for me to test my skills and delve into the intricacies of web development.
My goal was to create a comprehensive application that encompassed all aspects of web programming, from the user-facing front-end to the intricate back-end that powers the site.
Along the way, I encountered a multitude of challenges that needed to be addressed:

- **Database**: Selecting the most suitable database type, considering factors like cost, ease of implementation, and scalability.

- **Authentication**: Implementing a robust user authentication system, defining roles and access permissions.

- **Payments**: Integrating a payment gateway to handle subscription plans and recurring payments.

These are just a few examples of the hurdles I faced. What initially seemed like a straightforward task of building a website turned out to be far more complex.
However, I remained undeterred. My approach was to break down the project into smaller, manageable steps, even if I couldn't always complete them all in one sitting.
Often, I would focus on a specific aspect, making some progress, before shifting my attention to another area.

We've explored the genesis of Shortly, the initial challenges, and my approach to tackling them. Now, let's delve into the technical details of how I actually brought the website to life.
