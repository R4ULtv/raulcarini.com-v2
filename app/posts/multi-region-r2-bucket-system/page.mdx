I want to create a system to download large files cheaply with a worldwide infrastructure. 
Cloudflare is definitely the best option I've found, but there's a problem: the files are saved in a single region, for example in EEUR (Eastern Europe), so if I want to download a file from Singapore I have to connect to Vienna, for example, with obvious speed problems. 
The solution is to upload the same file to different regions around the world to reduce download times. 

Cloudflare provides 5 regions:

- **WNAM** - Western North America
- **ENAM** - Eastern North America
- **WEUR** - Western Europe
- **EEUR** - Eastern Europe
- **APAC** - Asia-Pacific

In this way, my large file can be downloaded at the maximum possible speed.

## How do I manage the download system?
