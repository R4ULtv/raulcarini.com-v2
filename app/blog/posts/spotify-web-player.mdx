Have you ever wished you could see your music come alive while listening to your favorite tracks?
That's exactly the experience I set out to create with my latest project: a [**Spotify Web Player**](https://web-player.raulcarini.dev) that transforms your music into *mesmerizing visual displays*.

## The Genesis of an Idea

The inspiration for this project struck during one of my late-night coding sessions.
While listening to music on [Spotify](https://spotify.com), I found myself wondering why the visual experience felt so disconnected from the audio.
Modern music players often treat visuals as an afterthought - a static album cover or basic progress bar. But music is *dynamic*, *emotional*, and *alive*.
Shouldn't our visual experience match that energy?

This thought led me down a rabbit hole of exploration into audio visualization and the [**Spotify Web API**](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/).
I discovered that Spotify provides rich data about tracks in real-time, including audio features like *tempo*, *energy*, and various *acoustic properties*.
What if we could harness this data to create dynamic visualizations that truly represent the music being played?

### What Makes This Player Special?

Unlike traditional web players, this project goes beyond basic playback controls. Here's what makes it unique:

- **Real-time Visualization**: The player creates stunning visual effects that respond directly to your music's rhythm, beat, and energy. Every song becomes a unique visual experience.
- **Seamless Spotify Integration**: By connecting directly to your [Spotify](https://spotify.com) account, you get instant access to your entire music library, playlists, and Spotify's vast catalog.
- **Customizable Experience**: Users can choose from different visualization styles and color themes to match their preferences or current mood.

## Authentication and Token Management with Next-Auth v5

A critical aspect of this project was implementing robust authentication with Spotify's OAuth system.
I chose to use [**Next-Auth v5 (Beta)**](https://authjs.dev/getting-started) over v4 for several compelling reasons:

  />
</a>

### Why Next-Auth v5?

The decision to use the beta version of [Next-Auth v5](https://authjs.dev) wasn't made lightly, but it offered several crucial advantages for this specific use case:

- **Edge Compatibility**: V5's built-in support for [React Server Actions](https://react.dev/reference/react/use-server) made it significantly easier to handle token refreshing and session management in a [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org) environment, while also ensuring compatibility with edge networks for improved performance.
- **Simplified Code and Setup**: V5's new token rotation system is more robust and easier to implement, which is crucial for maintaining uninterrupted access to Spotify's APIs. The simplified code and setup process also make it easier to maintain and update the project in the future.

### Token Revalidation Implementation

Here's how I implemented token revalidation using Next-Auth v5:

```js
// /lib/auth.js
async function refreshAccessToken(token) {
  try {
    // Endpoint for token refresh
    const url = "https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token";

    // Create Base64 encoded auth string
    const basicAuth = Buffer.from(
      `${process.env.AUTH_SPOTIFY_ID}:${process.env.AUTH_SPOTIFY_SECRET}`
    ).toString("base64");

    // Make refresh token request
    const response = await fetch(url, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: {
        Authorization: `Basic ${basicAuth}`,
        "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
      },
      body: new URLSearchParams({
        grant_type: "refresh_token",
        refresh_token: token.refreshToken,
      }),
    });

    const refreshedTokens = await response.json();

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw refreshedTokens;
    }

    // Return updated token information
    return {
      ...token,
      accessToken: refreshedTokens.access_token,
      accessTokenExpires: Date.now() + refreshedTokens.expires_in * 1000,
      refreshToken: refreshedTokens.refresh_token ?? token.refreshToken,
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error refreshing access token", error);
    return {
      ...token,
      error: "RefreshTokenError",
    };
  }
}
```

### Benefits of This Approach

This implementation provides several key benefits:

- **Seamless Token Refresh**: Users never experience authentication-related interruptions while using the player.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling ensures graceful degradation if authentication issues occur.
- **Performance**: Token validation and refresh operations are optimized to minimize API calls.

The v5 implementation has proven to be more reliable and maintainable than what was possible with v4, particularly when it comes to handling token refreshes and maintaining persistent connections to Spotify's services.

## Leveraging the Spotify Web API

The [**Spotify Web API**](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) serves as the backbone of this project, providing a rich set of endpoints that enable sophisticated music playback and data analysis capabilities.
Here's how we utilize various aspects of the API:

### Playback Control and Real-time Data

The Web API's playback endpoints allow us to create a seamless listening experience by:

- ***Controlling music playback*** (play, pause, skip, seek)
- ***Retrieving currently playing track information***
- ***Accessing real-time playback state***
- ***Managing playback queue and device selection***

### Premium Account Requirements

The Spotify Web API's functionality is tiered based on user account types, with certain advanced features exclusively available to [Premium subscribers](https://www.spotify.com/premium/). Here's what you need to know:
Premium-Only Features:

- **Playback controls** (play, pause, skip, seek)
- **Managing the playback queue** (including adding tracks to the queue)

### Limited Functionality for Free Users:

While free-tier users can access basic API features, they face significant restrictions on playback control and device management.
Of particular note is the queue management system - despite not being explicitly labeled as Premium-only in Spotify's documentation, it exhibits unreliable behavior for free users, often leading to inconsistent results.

#### Impact on Implementation:

To deliver a fully functional and reliable experience with features like:

- **Seamless playback control**
- **Queue manipulation**
- **Cross-device synchronization**

A [Premium account](https://www.spotify.com/premium/) is strongly recommended.
This requirement ensures users can access the complete range of interactive features and maintain consistent functionality across all aspects of the web player.
