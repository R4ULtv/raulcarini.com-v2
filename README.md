This is the newest version of my old portfolio, now with a better design. The website is built using Next.js 14, a React framework for building high-performance web applications.

## How to Use:
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Install the required dependencies (e.g., `npm install` or `yarn install`).
- Run the website locally using the command `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.
- Customize the website with your information, projects, and style.
- Deploy the website to a web hosting service like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/new/clone?project-name=Simple%20Portfolio&repository-name=raulcarini.com-v2&repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FR4ULtv%2Fraulcarini.com-v2).
